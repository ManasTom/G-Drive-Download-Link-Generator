THIS IS GUI APPLICATION THAT CAN BE USED ON WINDOWS DESKTOP FOR GENERATING DOWNLOAD LINKS FOR GOOGLE DRIVE FILES.

This can be used as a tool for devolopment purposes, where fles are stored in G-Drive and their down load links are to be formed.
The scenario is when large number of files are to be operated in such manner.One can copy the sharable link of some google drive file and paste it in this application and generate its download link at once. It uses pyhon language with TKinter.
This is actually made for an upcoming web devolopment project where large numbers of drive files will be kept for download through a web page. In such a situation, getting the download links for the files one by one will be a big task. That is where the application comes into play.
